OBSOLETE OsmoNITB User Manual
=============================
Harald Welte <hwelte@sysmocom.de>

WARNING:: osmo-nitb is obsolete since 2017. It is not actively maintained,
and it lack several man-years of development effort that went into the
so-called post-NITB stack consisting of separate OsmoBSC, OsmoMSC,
OsmoMGW and OsmoHLR.  You should not use this software except for
archaeological purpose. You will be on your own.  Do not contact the
developers about any issues you may experience while running unsuported,
obsolete software!
