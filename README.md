openbsc.git
===========

This is a HISTORICAL,OBSOLETE repository containing the code-base
of what used to be known as bs11_hack, later OpenBSC and also OsmoNITB.

Those projects have been superseded by OsmoBSC, OsmoMSC and OsmoHLR
(collectively known as Osmocom CNI).

The code in this repository is completely unmaintained, unsupported and
it is strongly discouraged to use it.  On the other hand, the modern
Osmocom CNI implementations are fully maintained and continuously
tested.

Do not bother the developers with questions about code from this
repository.
